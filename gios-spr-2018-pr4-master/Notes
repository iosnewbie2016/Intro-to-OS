minify_via_rpc.c

- allocate memory for your structs you defined in .x file;

- make sure to initialize the struct contents;

- after returning from call to rpc make sure to assign dst_len and dst_val appropriately;

- also do NOT free too soon or else you will see 0 bytes written to small file output;

 

minifyjpeg.c

- simplify simplify simplify and let magickminify() do the work (hint hint hint)
